                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p>I made this game as part of the Ludum Dare 53 Game Jam with another person as a group
                                project. The theme for this game jam was "Delivery" and we decided to make a game about
                                a delivery company receiving and shipping packages.</p>
                            <p>The game was coded in c# in Unity and the version control was handled through GitHub.</p>
                            <p>The gameplay controls took inspiration from the level select screen in the Overcooked
                                video game series. The core gameplay loop involves sucking up parcels from shops to
                                drive to and shoot at target homes. This was achieved by having a shop manager which
                                allocated parcels to homes and spawns them, and through a collector class which handled
                                recieving the package, additionally there was an inventory system which recorded which
                                parcels you had in the van. There was also a game over system inspired by the video game
                                Mini Metro where if there were too many unsent parcels it would activate a timer and
                                after a set time if there were still too many unsent parcels it would trigger a game
                                over</p>
                            <p>Parts of the game that I contributed to are the camera physics and control code, the code
                                of the UI elements and menu, parts of the level design and 3D modelling and most of the
                                sprite art and UI art.</p>

                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p>I did this project to explore the algoithms of ray casting, as I have an interest in the
                                math and technology of computer graphics</p>
                            <p>This was coded in python with the pygame module</p>
                            <p>After researching and reviewing articles and pages on ray casting, i decided to try to
                                code an implementation in python. I did this by building a grid of tiles that signify if
                                there is a wall there or not, and given the players position and its forward facing
                                direction cast rays from different angles relative to the player, each ray reording the
                                distance to the closest wall from that angle. With this information i can then construct
                                a view with each ray contributing a slice of the screen, with shorter slices
                                representing walls that are far away and vice versa. It was quite challenging to work
                                out the code as opposed to traditional vector directions, pygame's y vector is reversed.
                            </p>
                            <p>A lot of the development of the code was actually pen and paper working out of the
                                algorithm, the rendering was also quite tedious as I orignally set the relationship
                                between distance and slice size to be linear, which caused a "fish-eye" like effect,
                                eventually I used the square cube law to figure out that the slice size is proportional
                                to the square of the distance </p>
