                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p>I made this game as part of the Ludum Dare 53 Game Jam with another person as a group
                                project. The theme for this game jam was "Delivery" and we decided to make a game about
                                a delivery company receiving and shipping packages.</p>
                            <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample1">
                                <p>The game was coded in c# in Unity and the version control was handled through GitHub.
                                </p>
                                <p>The gameplay controls took inspiration from the level select screen in the Overcooked
                                    video game series. The core gameplay loop involves sucking up parcels from shops to
                                    drive to and shoot at target homes. This was achieved by having a shop manager which
                                    allocated parcels to homes and spawns them, and through a collector class which
                                    handled recieving the package, additionally there was an inventory system which
                                    recorded which parcels you had in the van. There was also a game over system
                                    inspired by the video game Mini Metro where if there were too many unsent parcels it
                                    would activate a timer and after a set time if there were still too many unsent
                                    parcels it would trigger a game over</p>
                                <p>Parts of the game that I contributed to are the camera physics and control code, the
                                    code of the UI elements and menu, parts of the level design and 3D modelling and
                                    most of the sprite art and UI art.

                            <p class="card-text">
                            <p>I did this project to explore the algoithms of ray casting, as I have an interest in the
                                math and technology of computer graphics</p>

                            <div class="collapse" id="collapseExample2">
                                <p>This was coded in python with the pygame module</p>
                                <p>After researching and reviewing articles and pages on ray casting, i decided to try
                                    to
                                    code an implementation in python. I did this by building a grid of tiles that
                                    signify if there is a wall there or not, and given the players position and its
                                    forward facing direction cast rays from different angles relative to the player,
                                    each ray recording the distance to the closest wall from that angle. With this
                                    information i can then construct a view with each ray contributing a slice of the
                                    screen, with shorter slices representing walls that are far away and vice versa. It
                                    was quite challenging to work out the code as opposed to traditional vector
                                    directions, pygame's y vector is reversed.
                                </p>
                                <p>Additionally I added the ability to jump, though this was a trick of the rendering, I
                                    simply moved the slices down inversely proportional to the jumping height to create
                                    the illusion of jumping.
                                </p>
                                <p>As an afterthought, I added the game snake to the project, this was achieved by
                                    adding a 'trail' to the player with varying length, and a 'fruit' to be collected by
                                    walking into it, the fruit is functionally the same as a wall but once the player
                                    touches it, it dissapears and another fruit is spawned at a random point in the map.
                                    Each fruit increments the trail length by one, of which is a history of the players
                                    movement, which is filled with walls to simulate the snake body</p>
                                <p>As a consequence to this, there is now a lose condition, if the player is walled in
                                    by its own body and/or the wall, then the screen will flash a message to say that
                                    the player has lost, and to press the x key to exit the game (the x key could always
                                    be pressed to leave the game but it not explicitly mentioned until now)</p>
                                <p>A lot of the development of the code was actually pen and paper working out of the
                                    algorithm, the rendering was also quite tedious as I orignally set the relationship
                                    between distance and slice size to be linear, which caused a "fish-eye" like effect,
                                    eventually I used the square cube law to figure out that the slice size is
                                    proportional to the square of the distance.
                                </p>

                            <p>When Chat-GPT first rose to popularity, I was quite intruiged by its technologies, thus I
                                did this project to explore the possibilities of its functions</p>

                                <p>This was coded in python and HTML with the flask framework with OpenAi's API</p>
                                <p>I first read through OpenAI's documentation to understand the API, then i used a
                                    flask skeleton to build my application, I used flask forms to handle the input to
                                    the backend and used the API to generate a response to the users messages. I also
                                    stored a history of the conversation and fed this history back into the AI to give
                                    it the context of the conversation so it could refer back to previous messages.
                                </p>
                                <p>I used flask's flash functionality to enable quick loading of the response after user
                                    input, and used bootstrap's elements to provide a responsive layout to the page.
                                </p>
                                <p>I decided to make the AI act as a can of diet coke as it is my favourite drink and I
                                    wanted to test the limits of the API. Overall this was quite a fun project to do and
                                    I learnt alot about Language models.

                                <p>This project was organised by having 4 sprints, I undertook the role of Scrum Master
                                    for some of these sprints and supported and organised my team in meeting and
                                    programming sessions, I also partook in pair programming for some of the tasks.
                                </p>
                                <p>This objectives were achieved by first making a skeleton of all the pages needed and
                                    making the databases required for the booking system and user accounts, then we
                                    implemented multiple flask forms to facilitate manager powers such as changing
                                    availability for the bookings, then using the databases and flask forms to create
                                    our booking system and payment system.
                                </p>
                                <p>There was also an emphasis on accessability, and through this project I learnt a lot
                                    about how different disabilties interact and use technology, and how small changes
                                    can mean big differences in accessability. Such as using colours, patterns and alt
                                    text.
                                </p>
